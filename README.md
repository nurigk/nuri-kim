## Application Overview

This is an interactive and responsive web application that I built to carry my recent works. Enjoy!

### Introduction
>It takes you to an introduction page with fun animations processed by GSAP. You can click "Explore" to navigate to different pages or hover over my photo to make it move. You can also simply scroll to the next section which showcases some of the software applications that I worked on recently.

### Software Applications
>You can click each titles to see the demo videos, technologies used, and the descriptions in pop-up windows. The GitHub icon takes you to the corresponding GitHub repositories.

### Resume / Contact me
>The last section includes the downloadable resume and some icons that will lead you to my email, LinedIn page, or Github page so we can connect! Hover over "Reach out to me" to see a cute dog in action.
